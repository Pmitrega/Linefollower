Project under construction. Robot is made on self-designed board with attached self-designed reflective sensors using ir diode and phototransistor.
For this moment there is algorithm estimating angle error, velocity control using PI controller, and angle P controller to follow line. Succesfully tested on track.
Can be also controlled using bluetooth with xbox controller by sending ascii commands.
