# Linefollower
Robot is made on self-designed board with attached self-designed reflective sensors using ir diode and phototransistor.
For this moment there is algorithm estimating angle error, velocity control using PI controller, and angle P controller to follow line. Succesfully tested on track.
Can be also controlled using bluetooth with xbox controller by sending ascii commands.

Project is finnished, probably won't be updated. Contiunation of LF project is under this link: [Linefollower_V2](https://github.com/Pmitrega/Linefollower_V2)
